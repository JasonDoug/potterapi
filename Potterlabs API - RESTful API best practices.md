**You:**

Can you tell me what the best practices are for a RESTful API when using groups of sub-collections of endpoints

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great question. When you have resources with natural “children” (sub‑collections), the trick is to keep URLs expressive without creating a maze. Here’s a compact set of best practices that scales well.

Core principles
===============

* **Model real resources first.** Treat every noun as a first‑class resource with its own canonical URI (even if you also expose it via a parent).
    
    * Canonical: `/members/{member_id}`
        
    * Contextual view: `/groups/{group_id}/members/{member_id}`
        
* **Use nesting only one level deep.** Nest when the child’s identity is naturally scoped by the parent or you’re returning the _relationship_.
    
    * Good: `/projects/{id}/tasks`
        
    * Avoid deep chains: `/orgs/{id}/teams/{id}/projects/{id}/tasks` → prefer filters.
        
* **Prefer filters over extra nesting.** If a child stands alone, expose it flat and filter by parent:
    
    * `/tasks?project_id={id}` instead of `/projects/{id}/tasks` (both can coexist; choose one to be canonical).
        
* **Stable IDs beat positional paths.** Use immutable, opaque IDs; don’t encode business meaning in them.
    

Resource & relationship patterns
================================

* **Sub‑collection (1:N)**
    
    * List: `GET /groups/{group_id}/members`
        
    * Create in context: `POST /groups/{group_id}/members` (body defines the member or links an existing member)
        
    * Single in context: `GET /groups/{group_id}/members/{member_id}`
        
* **Many‑to‑many via relationship resource**
    
    * Relationship collection: `POST /group_memberships` with `{ group_id, member_id, role }`
        
    * Also allow contextual convenience routes:
        
        * `POST /groups/{group_id}/members` (creates membership)
            
        * `DELETE /groups/{group_id}/members/{member_id}` (removes membership)
            
* **Canonical vs contextual**
    
    * Pick one canonical URI per resource (`/members/{id}`), and treat nested URIs as _views on the relationship_.
        
    * Return `self` and `related` links in payloads so clients can navigate both.
        

HTTP methods & semantics
========================

* **Collections**:
    
    * `GET` list, `POST` create
        
* **Items**:
    
    * `GET` read, `PATCH` partial update, `PUT` full replace (if you truly support it), `DELETE` delete
        
* **Relationship collections** (e.g., group ↔ member):
    
    * `POST /groups/{id}/members` → add link (409 if already linked)
        
    * `DELETE /groups/{id}/members/{member_id}` → remove link (204 on success)
        

Query design
============

* **Filtering**: `?member_id=`, `?status=active`, support simple ops; for complex filters consider `?filter=` objects or RQL‑like syntax.
    
* **Pagination**: cursor‑based (`?cursor=...&limit=50`) is safest; include `next`, `prev`, and `total_estimate` if feasible.
    
* **Sorting**: `?sort=-created_at,name`
    
* **Sparse fields**: `?fields=members(id,name,email)` to reduce payloads.
    
* **Expansion** (optional): `?include=groups` returns related resources in one round‑trip.
    

Status codes & errors
=====================

* **Use relationship‑aware codes**:
    
    * `201 Created` on create (Location header = canonical URI)
        
    * `204 No Content` on idempotent link/unlink
        
    * `404` if the _parent doesn’t exist_; `403` if it exists but caller lacks access
        
    * `409 Conflict` for duplicate relationship or state conflicts
        
* **Consistent error shape**: machine‑parsable (`code`, `message`, `fields`, `hint`, `docs`).
    

Consistency & naming
====================

* Plural nouns for collections (`/groups`, `/members`).
    
* Hyphen‑separated path segments; snake_case or camelCase in JSON (pick one and stick to it).
    
* Don’t mix verbs in paths; actions become resources or state transitions (or use a subresource like `/…/members:bulk-add` if you allow action‑style endpoints).
    

AuthZ boundaries
================

* **Check access at every level**: parent _and_ child.  
    Example: to list `/groups/{id}/members`, verify read on `group:{id}` and visibility of each `member`.
    
* **Leaked existence**: return 404 instead of 403 if you don’t want to reveal that a parent exists.
    

Performance, caching, and concurrency
=====================================

* **ETags** for all `GET`s; support `If-None-Match` (304) and conditional writes (`If-Match`) to prevent lost updates.
    
* **Cacheability**: mark list endpoints `Cache-Control: private, max-age=...` when safe; vary on auth when needed.
    
* **Bulk ops** for relationship sets to avoid N+1 round‑trips:
    
    * `POST /groups/{id}/members:batch` with `{ add: [...], remove: [...] }`.
        

Versioning & evolution
======================

* **Prefer header‑based or URI prefix versioning** (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.api.v2+json` or `/v2/...`).
    
* **Additive changes**: new fields should be optional; never repurpose existing ones.
    
* **Deprecations**: emit `Deprecation`/`Sunset` headers and document migration paths.
    

Documentation & discoverability
===============================

* **Document both canonical and contextual routes** and their semantics (is it creating a new child, or just linking one?).
    
* **Link relations**: include `self`, `canonical`, `parent`, `related` in responses to guide clients.
    

Security & limits
=================

* **Rate limit by principal and by parent** (so one hot group can’t starve others).
    
* **Validate parent/child IDs belong to the same tenant** to avoid cross‑tenant leaks.
    

Example: groups with sub‑collections
====================================

```
/groups
  GET                 list groups
  POST                create group

/groups/{group_id}
  GET                 fetch group
  PATCH               update group
  DELETE              delete group

/groups/{group_id}/members
  GET                 list members of group  (relationship view)
  POST                add membership         (body: { member_id, role } or { name, email } to create+link)

/groups/{group_id}/members/{member_id}
  GET                 view member in context (includes role)
  DELETE              remove membership

/members
  GET                 list members (filterable by group_id)
  POST                create member

/members/{member_id}
  GET|PATCH|DELETE    canonical member resource

/group-memberships
  POST                create membership (explicit relationship resource)
  GET                 list memberships (filter by group_id/member_id)
```

Anti‑patterns to avoid
======================

* Deeply nested URLs (`/a/b/c/d/e`) → hard to authorize, cache, and evolve.
    
* Creating global resources **only** via nested paths but not giving them a canonical URI.
    
* Overloading `PUT` to mean “partial update”; use `PATCH`.
    
* Hiding pagination behind `page`/`per_page` with no cursors on large, changing sets.
    

* * *

If you want, describe your specific resources (e.g., Groups, Teams, Projects, Members, Roles), and I’ll sketch an exact URI map and JSON schemas that follow these rules.

* * *

**You:**

What's the point of /v0 or /v1

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

The `/v0`, `/v1`, `/v2`, etc. in API URLs are **explicit API version identifiers**.

They serve a few important purposes in RESTful API design:

* * *

**1. Maintain Backward Compatibility**
--------------------------------------

* Once you publish a version, you **freeze its behavior** so clients using it won’t suddenly break when you make changes.
    
* If you need to change your API in a way that isn’t backward-compatible (breaking change), you introduce a new version instead of modifying the old one.
    

Example:

```
/v1/groups
/v2/groups
```

`/v2` might have renamed fields, changed authentication, or altered request/response formats without affecting `/v1`.

* * *

**2. Communicate Contract Stability**
-------------------------------------

* The version number tells clients: “Everything under `/v1/` behaves according to the v1 spec.”
    
* Developers know what to expect, even if the API internally evolves.
    
* Helps in debugging and support: you can immediately tell what data shape and semantics a client is seeing.
    

* * *

**3. Decouple Client & Server Release Cycles**
----------------------------------------------

* Clients can upgrade **when they’re ready** instead of being forced to match the server’s latest changes.
    
* Large organizations often have multiple client versions running in the wild—versioned APIs let them coexist.
    

* * *

**4. Allow Parallel Development**
---------------------------------

* You can run `/v1` in production while developing `/v2` in parallel.
    
* Makes it easier to test and migrate users gradually.
    

* * *

**5. Control Deprecation**
--------------------------

* Older versions can be sunset gradually:
    
    * Announce deprecation.
        
    * Continue to serve `/v1` until a cutoff date.
        
    * Encourage migration to `/v2`.
        

* * *

**Common Patterns**
-------------------

* **URI versioning** (most common for public APIs):
    
    ```
    GET /v1/groups
    GET /v2/groups
    ```
    
* **Header versioning** (cleaner URLs, but less obvious to consumers):
    
    ```
    GET /groups
    Accept: application/vnd.myapp.v2+json
    ```
    
* **Query parameter versioning** (less common, often discouraged for caching reasons):
    
    ```
    GET /groups?version=2
    ```
    

* * *

**Best Practice for REST APIs**
-------------------------------

* Use **major versions only** in the URI (`/v1`) to signal breaking changes.
    
* Minor, backward-compatible changes (adding optional fields, adding endpoints) **should not bump the version**.
    
* Keep old versions running long enough for clients to migrate.
    
* Clearly document version differences.
    
* Include a `Deprecation` and `Sunset` header in older versions when you plan to retire them.
    

* * *

If you want, I can give you a **decision flow** for when to introduce `/v2` vs. when to keep enhancing `/v1`—that’s something a lot of teams get wrong and end up with `/v1` APIs that are breaking without warning.

* * *

**You:**

Ok. My initial thoughts for my API was to have very low level endpoints like /video that allows video generation with various providers and then create other endpoint that provide further abstraction like /story. How would that look

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Got it, Jason. You’re imagining a **thin, low-level render API** (e.g., `/video`) that talks to multiple providers, and **higher-level abstractions** (e.g., `/story`) that orchestrate multi-step workflows (script → scenes → shots → renders). Below is a clean way to structure that, keep it evolvable, and avoid tight coupling.

High-level shape (v1)
=====================

```
/v1/providers
/v1/capabilities
/v1/assets
/v1/videos           # low-level render jobs (single clip)
/v1/storyboards      # mid-level: scenes & shots, image refs, timing
/v1/stories          # high-level: takes text/script; orchestrates storyboard->video(s)
/v1/presets          # reusable parameter sets (per provider or abstract)
/v1/pipelines        # saved multi-step graphs (compose your own abstraction)
/v1/webhooks         # endpoints the platform will call back
```

Why this shape
--------------

* **Single, canonical low-level primitive**: `/videos` = “render this clip with these parameters,” regardless of provider.
    
* **Abstractions as first-class resources**: `/stories` and `/storyboards` produce structured plans and then call `/videos` behind the scenes.
    
* **Pluggable providers** without leaking their quirks into your public contract.
    
* Everything is **job-based** and **idempotent**; you can fan-out/fan-in safely.
    

* * *

Low-level: `/videos`
====================

Use this for direct, provider-agnostic renders. It represents a **render job**.

**Create (async):**

```
POST /v1/videos
Idempotency-Key: <uuid>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "provider": "kling",                // or "ltx", "minimax", "elevenlabs_video"
  "preset_id": "p_kling_sdxl_24fps",  // optional
  "inputs": {
    "prompt": "A neon city flythrough",
    "duration_sec": 10,
    "fps": 24,
    "resolution": "1080p",
    "seed": 12345
  },
  "overrides": {                      // optional provider-specific tuning (namespaced)
    "kling": { "motion_weight": 0.7 }
  },
  "assets": [                         // optional: reference uploaded assets
    { "id": "a_bgtrack_123", "role": "audio" },
    { "id": "a_ref_42", "role": "image_reference" }
  ],
  "webhook": {                        // optional per-job callback
    "url": "https://your.app/hooks/render",
    "secret": "whs_..."
  },
  "metadata": {
    "project_id": "proj_42",
    "trace_id": "abc-123"
  }
}
```

**Response (202 Accepted):**

```
{
  "id": "vid_9mJr...",
  "status": "queued",                 // queued|running|succeeded|failed|canceled
  "provider": "kling",
  "created_at": "...",
  "links": {
    "self": "/v1/videos/vid_9mJr...",
    "result": null
  }
}
```

**Fetch status/result:**

```
GET /v1/videos/{video_id}
```

On success:

```
{
  "id": "vid_9mJr...",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "artifact": {
    "url": "https://cdn.../vid_9mJr.mp4",
    "mime": "video/mp4",
    "duration_sec": 10,
    "resolution": "1920x1080"
  },
  "cost": { "input_tokens": 0, "output_tokens": 0, "credits": 123 },
  "logs": [...],
  "metrics": { "queue_ms": 320, "run_ms": 11876 }
}
```

**Rationale**

* **Idempotency-Key** prevents duplicate charges on client retries.
    
* `preset_id` gives stable, documented defaults per provider; `overrides.{provider}` prevents cross-provider leakage.
    
* Treat result as an **artifact**, not inline bytes; serve from your CDN.
    

* * *

High-level: `/stories` (script → storyboard → (one or many) videos)
===================================================================

**Create a story** from plain text or a structured script:

```
POST /v1/stories
Idempotency-Key: <uuid>

{
  "title": "Midnight Heist",
  "input": {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT ...",
    "language": "en"
  },
  "options": {
    "target_style": "ghibli-noir",
    "max_scenes": 12,
    "shot_density": "medium"
  },
  "render": {
    "strategy": "per-shot",           // "per-scene" or "single-compile"
    "provider": "kling",
    "preset_id": "p_kling_cinematic_24fps"
  },
  "webhook": { "url": "https://your.app/hooks/story", "secret": "whs_..." }
}
```

**Response:**

```
{
  "id": "story_7xQ...",
  "status": "storyboarding",          // storyboarding|rendering|succeeded|failed
  "links": {
    "self": "/v1/stories/story_7xQ...",
    "storyboard": "/v1/storyboards/sb_4K2...",
    "renders": "/v1/stories/story_7xQ.../videos"
  }
}
```

**What happens under the hood (transparent but documented):**

1. **Derive storyboard** → `/v1/storyboards` (scenes → shots → timing → assets placeholders).
    
2. **Render plan**:
    
    * If `strategy=per-shot`, fan-out to many `/v1/videos` (short clips), then **stitch** (your service can do this or expose `/v1/compose` if you want a separate step).
        
    * If `single-compile`, produce one long `/v1/videos` job with concatenated prompts and timing hints.
        
3. **Deliver final artifact** + optional intermediate artifacts (clips, thumbnails, captions, SRT).
    

**Get full story state:**

```
GET /v1/stories/{story_id}
```

Returns:

```
{
  "id": "story_7xQ...",
  "status": "rendering",
  "storyboard_id": "sb_4K2...",
  "videos": [
    { "shot_id": "shot_01", "video_id": "vid_a1" },
    { "shot_id": "shot_02", "video_id": "vid_a2" }
  ],
  "final": null
}
```

* * *

Mid-level: `/storyboards` (scenes & shots with minimal elements)
================================================================

For your “just extract scenes with minimal elements” requirement.

**Create storyboard from text or JSON script:**

```
POST /v1/storyboards
{
  "source": {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT ..."
  },
  "options": {
    "include": ["scenes", "shots", "characters", "locations", "beats"], 
    "exclude": ["camera_moves", "lenses"]          // keep it minimal
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```
{
  "id": "sb_4K2...",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "scenes": [
    {
      "id": "sc_01",
      "slug": "INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT",
      "summary": "Crew enters...",
      "shots": [
        {
          "id": "shot_01",
          "beat": "Entry",
          "duration_sec": 3.5,
          "prompt": "Wide shot of dim warehouse...",
          "characters": ["Alex", "Mara"],
          "location": "Warehouse floor"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "self": "/v1/storyboards/sb_4K2...",
    "to_videos": "/v1/storyboards/sb_4K2.../render"
  }
}
```

**Convenience “render this storyboard” route:**

```
POST /v1/storyboards/{id}/render
{
  "strategy": "per-shot",
  "provider": "kling",
  "preset_id": "p_kling_cinematic_24fps"
}
```

Returns a **compose job**:

```
{
  "id": "compose_c8T...",
  "status": "running",
  "links": { "final_video": null, "clips": "/v1/compose/compose_c8T.../clips" }
}
```

* * *

Shared building blocks
======================

Providers & capabilities
------------------------

```
GET /v1/providers
→ [ { "id": "kling", "status": "available" }, { "id": "ltx", ... } ]

GET /v1/capabilities?provider=kling
→ {
  "video": {
    "max_resolution": ["720p","1080p","4k"],
    "fps": [24,25,30],
    "features": ["image_ref", "audio_bed", "seed", "negative_prompt"]
  }
}
```

* Keep provider quirks discoverable here, **not** in your public request schema.
    

Presets
-------

```
POST /v1/presets
{ "id": "p_kling_cinematic_24fps", "provider": "kling", "defaults": { "fps": 24, "motion_weight": 0.7 } }
```

* Lets teams standardize creative direction without re-sending big payloads.
    

Assets
------

```
POST /v1/assets (multipart or signed URL init)
GET /v1/assets/{id}
```

* Reuse across jobs; attach roles in `/videos` or `/storyboards`.
    

Pipelines (make your abstractions composable)
---------------------------------------------

A **saved graph** that you or users can run:

```
POST /v1/pipelines
{
  "name": "Story->Storyboard->Per-shot Render",
  "graph": [
    { "id": "n1", "op": "storyboard.create", "in": { "text": "@input.text" } },
    { "id": "n2", "op": "storyboard.render", "in": { "storyboard_id": "@n1.id", "provider": "kling" } },
    { "id": "n3", "op": "compose.concat", "in": { "clips": "@n2.clip_ids" } }
  ]
}
POST /v1/pipelines/{id}/run
```

* * *

Semantics, ops & guardrails (concise rules)
===========================================

* **Versioning**: Major only in path (`/v1`). Additive changes don’t bump version.
    
* **Async by default**: 202 on creation; poll `GET` or use **webhooks** + **event stream** (`GET /v1/events?cursor=...`).
    
* **Idempotency**: Require `Idempotency-Key` on all POSTs that create work; return the same job if retried.
    
* **Partial failure**: For story fan-outs, expose per-shot statuses and allow **resume** (`POST /v1/stories/{id}:resume` with a list of failed shots).
    
* **Rate limiting**: Return `429` with `Retry-After`. Consider **per-project** and **per-provider** buckets.
    
* **ETags** on GETs; `If-Match` on PATCH for safe concurrent edits of storyboards.
    
* **Errors**: Uniform shape:
    
    ```
    { "error": { "code":"invalid_param", "message":"fps not supported", "field":"inputs.fps", "hint":"See /capabilities" } }
    ```
    
* **Security**: Provider creds live server-side; clients only select `provider` and `preset_id`. Support **scoped API keys** and project isolation.
    
* **Observability**: Every job has `metrics` and `logs` arrays; expose a lightweight `GET /v1/jobs/{id}/logs?tail=200`.
    

* * *

Concrete “happy paths”
======================

### 1) Power user (low-level)

* Upload assets → `POST /v1/assets`
    
* Kick a render → `POST /v1/videos { provider, inputs, assets }`
    
* Poll → `GET /v1/videos/{id}`
    
* Get MP4 → `artifact.url`
    

### 2) One-shot story (high-level)

* `POST /v1/stories { input.text, render.strategy="single-compile" }`
    
* Poll story → final artifact once done
    

### 3) Storyboard first, minimal elements only

* `POST /v1/storyboards { source.text, options.exclude=["camera_moves","lenses"] }`
    
* (Optionally) render later:
    
    * `POST /v1/storyboards/{id}/render { strategy:"per-shot", provider:"..." }`
        

* * *

Naming tips
===========

* Keep low-level **generic** (`/videos`), not `/render` (too verbish).
    
* Keep high-level nouns **domain-true**: `/stories`, `/storyboards`, `/scenes`, `/shots`.
    
* Relationship views (sub-collections) where helpful:
    
    ```
    GET /v1/stories/{id}/scenes
    GET /v1/storyboards/{id}/shots
    GET /v1/stories/{id}/videos
    ```
    

* * *

If this aligns, I’ll turn it into a **mini spec pack** (OpenAPI stubs + JSON Schemas + example payloads) with the sub-collections wired exactly as above so you can drop it into your repo.

* * *

**You:**

ok this all aligns

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Perfect 🙌 — glad it clicks into place.

So just to make sure I’m following your mental model correctly, Jason:

* **Low-level layer** → `/videos` (canonical, provider-agnostic render jobs, fully parameterized).
    
* **Mid-level abstraction** → `/storyboards` (scenes/shots, minimal elements, optional render fan-out).
    
* **High-level abstraction** → `/stories` (script-to-storyboard orchestration, optional auto-render, convenience for end-users).
    
* Supporting resources (`/providers`, `/capabilities`, `/presets`, `/assets`, `/pipelines`, `/webhooks`) keep it flexible and composable.
    
* One major version in the URI (`/v1`), with additive changes living inside that version.
    
* Jobs are async, idempotent, and linked with consistent `self` / `related` links.
    

If that’s still consistent with what you’re picturing, I can draft:

1. **OpenAPI stubs** (paths, schemas, responses).
    
2. **Canonical payload examples** for `/videos`, `/storyboards`, and `/stories`.
    
3. A **migration plan** (how to extend from v0 “scratchpad” endpoints → v1 public contract without breakage).
    

👉 Do you want me to go ahead and produce the **mini spec pack** next (OpenAPI + JSON schemas), or would you rather see a **simplified diagram/flow** first that visually shows how `/story` → `/storyboard` → `/videos` connect?

**You:**

mini spec pack

**ChatGPT:**

awesome — here’s a concise, drop-in **mini spec pack**: one OpenAPI 3.1 file (YAML) with all paths + schemas, plus a few example `curl` calls. It encodes the layering we agreed on:

* low-level: `/v1/videos` (render jobs)
    
* mid-level: `/v1/storyboards` (+ `/render`)
    
* high-level: `/v1/stories` (+ per-shot fan-out, resume)
    
* supporting: `/providers`, `/capabilities`, `/presets`, `/assets`, `/events`, `/jobs/{id}/logs`

Notes & implementation cues (tight)
===================================

* **Async by default**: POSTs return 202/201 with job IDs; clients poll `GET` or consume `/v1/events` (SSE).
    
* **Idempotency**: Required header on POSTs that create work; on retry, return the _same_ job.
    
* **Provider isolation**: Public schema is stable; quirks live in `/v1/capabilities` and `overrides.{provider}`.
    
* **ETags** on `GET` of items; support `If-None-Match` and `If-Match` (for `PATCH` if/when you add edits).
    
* **Errors**: Single shape with `code/message/field/hint/docs`.
    
* **Pagination**: cursor-based with `next/prev` and `Link` header.
    
* **Security**: project-scoped API keys; rate-limit per principal & per provider bucket.
    
* **Observability**: `/v1/jobs/{id}/logs` for last N lines; include `metrics.queue_ms` and `run_ms`.
    

* * *

if you want, I can split the schemas into separate JSON Schema files and generate a **typed client** (TS) from this OpenAPI.

**You:**

this is perfect. ok now another sub-group I need to have (or maybe they are options within the above) is to produce a slideshow-type video with music and a voice-over. So low-level service are (I think) /script, /voices, /music /images. Then mid-level abstraction that takes the produced script and voices to produce a /voiceover, another that detects the story beats in the script, uses /images to produce a /pre-slideshow and /background-music, and then high level that takes the voiceover, produced music and pre-slideshow and lays them all together for the final video...help me flesh this out better

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Love it. Quick playback to confirm intent:

* **Low-level primitives** you want to expose: `/scripts`, `/voices`, `/music`, `/images` (each provider-agnostic, job-oriented).
    
* **Mid-level abstractions** that _compose_ those:
    
    * `/voiceovers` (script → TTS w/ voice & pacing)
        
    * `/beats` (detect story beats from a script)
        
    * `/slideshows` (beats → slides: pick/generate images, attach captions & timings)
        
    * `/background-music` (music that fits beats/tempo/duration)
        
* **High-level**: a single job that takes a voiceover + slideshow + music and lays them together into the **final video** (reusing `/videos` under the hood).
    

If that’s right, here’s a clean, evolvable shape that plugs into your existing `/v1` API.

* * *

Layered resource map
====================

Low-level (atomic jobs)
-----------------------

```
/v1/scripts            # parse/clean/segment script (optional if client supplies)
/v1/voices             # catalog & voice assets (TTS providers, custom clones)
/v1/music              # generate or select music tracks (jobs)
/v1/images             # generate or select images (jobs)
/v1/assets             # (already defined) upload/reference external media
```

Mid-level (domain orchestrators)
--------------------------------

```
/v1/voiceovers         # script -> audio narration (TTS), with pauses & SSML-ish marks
/v1/beats              # script -> story beats (timestamps, emphasis, sectioning)
/v1/slideshows         # beats -> slides (image selection/gen + captions + durations)
/v1/background-music   # target mood/duration -> bed track aligned to beats
```

High-level (final assembly)
---------------------------

```
/v1/slideshow-videos   # voiceover + slideshow + background-music -> final MP4
                        (internally: fan-out to /videos for per-slide clips, or single compile)
```

> Philosophy: keep _nouns_ first-class, jobs async/idempotent, and let higher layers reference lower artifacts by ID.

Typical flows (happy paths)
===========================

### A) “One-click” high level

1. Create **script** (optional) → `/scripts`
    
2. **Voiceover** → `/voiceovers { script_id, voice_id }`
    
3. **Beats** → `/beats { script_id }`
    
4. **Slideshow** → `/slideshows { beats_id, image_strategy }`
    
5. **Background music** → `/background-music { voiceover_id, slideshow_id }`
    
6. **Final video** → `/slideshow-videos { voiceover_id, slideshow_id, music_id }`
    

### B) Power user swaps parts

* Reuse a pre-made voiceover (`vo_*`) or upload a narration asset (`/assets`) and skip `/voiceovers`.
    
* Provide your own images via `/assets` and build `/slideshows` with those asset IDs.
    

* * *

Design notes & guardrails
=========================

* **Idempotency**: require `Idempotency-Key` on POSTs that create work (voiceovers, images, music, background-music, slideshow-videos).
    
* **Timing authority**: if `voiceover` exists, prefer `timing_strategy.mode="fit-voiceover"` for `/slideshows` so slide durations derive from narration markers (fewer lip-sync surprises).
    
* **Markers everywhere**:
    
    * `/voiceovers.markers[]` → section/beat → `time_sec`
        
    * `/slideshows.slides[]` → `start_sec`/`duration_sec`  
        This makes `/slideshow-videos` a deterministic composition.
        
* **Ducking**: allow simple music ducking at composition (`options.ducking.threshold_db`, `attack_ms`, `release_ms`).
    
* **Stitch strategy**: if slides are many, you can optionally render per-slide video clips via `/videos` (with Ken Burns/pan/zoom) and then concatenate. Expose this as an internal `strategy:"per-slide"` toggle on `/slideshow-videos` if you want.
    
* **Reusability**: every produced artifact (voiceover, images, music) is a first-class thing you can swap.
    
* **Observability**: all mid/high-level jobs return `metrics` and a `links.logs` tail (just like `/videos`).
    
* **Capabilities**: extend `/v1/capabilities` to include:
    
    * `tts` (voices, languages, sample rates, styles)
        
    * `image` (models, max resolution, ref support)
        
    * `music` (styles, stems, max duration)
        

* * *

Practical tips (so it “feels good” to use)
==========================================

* **Make `/voiceovers` produce SRT/VTT** (optional) alongside audio; then `/slideshow-videos` can burn captions easily.
    
* **Expose a lightweight `/mixes` or `/timelines` resource** if you foresee non-slideshow compositions later (N tracks, arbitrary regions). For now, `/slideshow-videos` is a specialized timeline.
    
* **Allow `assets[]` in `/slideshows`** to seed preferred images; fall back to generation only where missing.
    
* **Return `hints`** on validation errors, e.g., “voice ‘vx_emma’ supports 22.05/44.1/48kHz; you sent 96kHz.”
    
* **Determinism knobs**: `seed` for images/music where providers support it to make runs reproducible.
    

* * *

If you want, I can **merge these into your existing OpenAPI** from the mini spec pack and add 6–8 golden-path example requests you can run in Postman right away.

* * *

**You:**

lets make this one standalone for now and let THIS be the basis of which we add on other sub-groups

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Cherry here — quick playback to lock intent before I move: you want a **standalone API spec** dedicated to the slideshow pipeline (script → beats → images → voiceover → background-music → final slideshow video), and this spec will be the **base** we extend later with other sub-groups. No coupling to your earlier `/videos` etc. I’ll generate a clean **OpenAPI 3.1** file plus example requests you can use immediately.

Creating the files now.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

🔥 Done. Here’s your **standalone base spec** for the slideshow pipeline:

* Download `openapi-slideshow.yaml`
    
* Download `curl-quickstart.sh`
    
* README.md (overview & notes)
    

### What’s inside (tight overview)

* **Nouns (low-level):** `/scripts`, `/images`, `/voices` (catalog/custom), `/voiceovers`, `/background-music`, `/assets`
    
* **Orchestrators (mid-level):** `/beats`, `/slideshows`
    
* **High-level assembly:** `/slideshow-videos` (final MP4; supports transitions, captions, music ducking)
    
* **Infra:** `/events` (SSE), `/jobs/{id}/logs` (debug), idempotent POSTs, cursor pagination, uniform errors
    

### Opinionated defaults you’ll like

* **Sync by design:** `voiceovers.markers[]` + `slideshows.slides[*].start_sec/duration_sec` → deterministic composition
    
* **Timing strategies:** `auto`, `fixed`, or **`fit-voiceover`** (recommended once narration exists)
    
* **Music bed:** `duration_policy: fit` + simple ducking (`threshold_db`, `attack_ms`, `release_ms`)
    
* **Artifacts as URLs:** serve via your CDN; keep payloads slim
    

If this looks good, we can later “bolt on” other sub-groups (e.g., `/videos`, `/storyboards`, `/stories`) as separate specs or as additional tags in this one—your call.

* * *

**You:**

ok, so i guess the first step is to do the providers, those are the lowest of the low level right

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Cherry here — quick playback: yes, starting with **Providers** (registry + capabilities) is the right “bottom of the stack.” I’ll extend your standalone spec with:

* `/v1/providers` (list + details + health)
    
* `/v1/capabilities` and `/v1/providers/{id}/capabilities`
    
* `/v1/presets` (provider-scoped defaults for voices/images/music)
    
* Selection semantics (`provider: "auto"` + routing rules)
    

Updating your OpenAPI now and dropping in examples.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Absolutely—providers are the “bedrock.” I’ve extended your standalone spec so **providers/capabilities/presets** are first-class and everything else can build on top.

### Updated spec (now includes providers)

* Updated `openapi-slideshow.yaml`
    
* Examples:
    
    * curl-quickstart.sh
        
    * curl-providers.sh
        
* README.md
    

### What “Providers first” gives you

* **/v1/providers** — list and inspect providers (by kind: `tts`, `image`, `music`, `compose`)
    
* **/v1/providers/{id}/health** — quick operational snapshot (`available|degraded|unavailable`, p50/p95, success rate)
    
* **/v1/providers/{id}/capabilities** and **/v1/capabilities** — discover model features without leaking quirks into public job schemas
    
* **/v1/presets** — provider-scoped defaults for reproducibility (e.g., “Doc Narration 48kHz”, “Minimalist 16:9”)
    

### Recommended routing semantics (clean & flexible)

* Every creation endpoint (`/voiceovers`, `/images`, `/background-music`, `/slideshow-videos`) accepts:
    
    * `provider: "<id>"` **or** `provider: "auto"`.
        
* If `auto`, your router chooses based on:
    
    1. **Preset** (if provided) → locks provider + defaults
        
    2. **Capabilities match** (sample rate, aspect ratio, stems, etc.)
        
    3. **Health** (prefer `available`, fall back if `degraded`)
        
    4. **Cost policy** (optional: cheapest that satisfies constraints)
        
* Return the chosen provider in the job’s payload for traceability.
    

### Minimal provider taxonomy (start set)

* `elevenlabs` → `kind: tts` (voices, SSML, 22.05/44.1/48kHz)
    
* `genai` → `kind: image` (generate/search, 16:9, negative prompts, style refs)
    
* `audiogen` → `kind: music` (styles, stems, max duration)
    
* `compositor` → `kind: compose` (transitions, fps, resolutions)
    

You can register more providers later without altering higher-level contracts—just expand capabilities and add presets.

### Quick examples

List image providers:

```bash
curl -s 'https://api.example.com/v1/providers?kind=image'
```

Get a provider’s capabilities:

```bash
curl -s 'https://api.example.com/v1/providers/genai/capabilities'
```

Create a preset (tts):

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/presets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
  -d '{
    "id":"p_elevenlabs_doc_narration",
    "provider":"elevenlabs",
    "kind":"tts",
    "defaults":{"voice_id":"vx_emma","sample_rate_hz":48000,"format":"wav","pace":"medium","ssml":true}
  }'
```

### Next best step

* Wire your **router** to consult `capabilities` + `health` + `presets` before firing jobs.
    
* Add a **per-provider cost table** (internal) to support “cheapest viable” when `provider:"auto"`.
    

If you want, I can sketch the **router decision tree** (pseudo-code) and a minimal **providers table** schema you can drop into your DB.

* * *

**You:**

can you put together a pack for all the slideshow stuff too

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Cherry here — confirming intent: you want a **complete “slideshow pack”** you can drop into a repo, including OpenAPI, split JSON Schemas, runnable examples, and a Postman collection/env for quick testing. I’ll generate:

* `openapi-slideshow.yaml` (updated)
    
* `/schemas/*.json` (split from OpenAPI)
    
* `/examples/*.json` + `curl/*.sh`
    
* `Postman_Collection.json` + `Postman_Env.json`
    
* `README.md` with golden paths & setup
    

Building it now.

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

All set — here’s your **Slideshow API Starter Pack** you can drop into a repo:

* OpenAPI spec (`openapi-slideshow.yaml`)
    
* Schemas (split JSON): folder
    
* Examples (request bodies): folder
    
* Curl scripts: quickstart.sh · providers.sh
    
* Postman: Postman_Collection.json · Postman_Env.json
    
* README: README.md
    

### What you get

* **Providers-first foundation** (`/providers`, `/capabilities`, `/presets`) so routing and defaults are clean.
    
* **Complete slideshow pipeline**: `/scripts → /beats → /images → /voiceovers → /background-music → /slideshow-videos`.
    
* **Reproducibility** via presets; **deterministic sync** via voiceover markers + slide timings.
    
* **Ready to test** in Postman or via the curl scripts (uses `Idempotency-Key` everywhere).
    

Want me to add a tiny **router decision tree** (pseudo-code) and a **sample SSE client** for `/v1/events`?

* * *

**You:**

i was not able to download
Schemas (split JSON): folder

Examples (request bodies): folder

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Got it — the UI won’t let you click into folders, only individual files.  
Let me repackage those **schemas** and **examples** into ZIPs so you can download them in one shot.

I’ll create:

* `schemas.zip` → all the JSON Schemas
    
* `examples.zip` → all the example request bodies

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Here you go — you can download the folders as ZIPs now:

* Schemas (JSON) — `schemas.zip`
    
* Examples (request bodies) — `examples.zip`
    

That should make them easy to grab and unpack locally. Want me to do the same for the `curl/` scripts too?

* * *

**You:**

ok and with this foundation i can add the first subgroup we did /videos, /stories and /storyboards, etc? The /provider and /capabilities should be compatible?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Short answer: **yes**. The providers/capabilities/presets you’ve got are designed to be the foundation, and they’re compatible with adding the earlier subgroup (`/videos`, `/storyboards`, `/stories`) on top.

Here’s how to bolt them on cleanly.

What stays the same (no changes needed)
=======================================

* **Providers registry**: keep using `/v1/providers` and `/v1/providers/{id}/capabilities` to advertise what each provider can do.
    
* **Presets**: continue to pin provider-defaults via `/v1/presets` for reproducible runs.
    
* **Jobs model**: async `POST` → 202/201 + idempotency, poll `GET`, same error shape, same logs/events patterns.
    

Minimal extensions (so `/videos` et al. snap in)
================================================

1. **Add a `video` modality** alongside `tts`, `image`, `music`, `compose`.
    
    * In `Capabilities`, add a `video` block.
        
    * In `Preset.kind`, allow `"video"`.
        
2. **Add the low/mid/high endpoints**:
    
    * Low-level: `/v1/videos` (render a single clip with provider params)
        
    * Mid-level: `/v1/storyboards` (+ `/render`)
        
    * High-level: `/v1/stories` (orchestrates storyboard → videos → compose)
        

* * *

1) Capabilities & Presets: tiny patch
-------------------------------------

### Capabilities (add `video`)

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Capabilities:
      type: object
      properties:
        video:
          type: object
          properties:
            max_resolution: { type: array, items: { type: string } }   # ["720p","1080p","4k"]
            fps:            { type: array, items: { type: integer } }  # [24,25,30]
            features:       { type: array, items: { type: string } }   # ["image_ref","seed","negative_prompt"]
      additionalProperties: true
```

### Presets (allow kind: video)

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Preset:
      type: object
      properties:
        id: { type: string }
        provider: { type: string }
        kind: { type: string, enum: [tts, image, music, compose, video] }
        defaults: { type: object, additionalProperties: true }
      required: [id, provider, kind, defaults]
```

> This keeps your provider discovery consistent: a provider that supports video just returns `video` capabilities, same style as `tts/image/music`.

* * *

2) Paths to add (exactly what we drafted earlier)
-------------------------------------------------

### `/v1/videos`

* **POST** create a provider-agnostic render job (`provider:"kling"` or `"auto"`; `preset_id` optional)
    
* **GET** fetch status/result
    
* **DELETE** cancel
    

### `/v1/storyboards`

* **POST** build scenes/shots from text/JSON
    
* **GET** fetch storyboard
    
* **POST /v1/storyboards/{id}/render`** render per-shot/per-scene to clips (optional final stitch)
    

### `/v1/stories`

* **POST** high-level orchestration (script → storyboard → fan-out renders → compose)
    
* **GET** status + links to storyboard/videos/final
    

You can literally paste the stubs from the earlier “mini spec pack” for these paths/schemas into this repo; they share the same primitives (artifacts, webhooks, logs, error shape).

* * *

3) Routing semantics (stays consistent)
---------------------------------------

All creation endpoints can accept:

* `provider: "<id>"` **or** `provider: "auto"`
    
* optional `preset_id: "p_*"`
    

**Router** resolves:

1. If `preset_id` present → locks provider + defaults
    
2. Validate against `/capabilities` (e.g., fps/resolution/feature flags)
    
3. Prefer providers with good `/health`
    
4. Optional cost policy (cheapest viable)
    
5. Record chosen provider in job payload
    

Same rule applies to `/videos`, `/voiceovers`, `/images`, `/background-music`, `/slideshow-videos`.

* * *

4) Concrete add-on snippets
---------------------------

### Add `/v1/videos` request schema

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    VideoCreateRequest:
      type: object
      properties:
        provider: { type: string, example: kling }     # or "auto"
        preset_id: { type: string, nullable: true }
        inputs:
          type: object
          properties:
            prompt: { type: string }
            duration_sec: { type: number }
            fps: { type: integer }
            resolution: { type: string, example: 1080p }
            seed: { type: integer, nullable: true }
          required: [prompt]
        overrides:
          type: object
          additionalProperties: true   # namespaced by provider internally
        assets:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              id: { type: string }
              role: { type: string, example: image_reference }
            required: [id]
        webhook: { $ref: '#/components/schemas/Webhook' }
      required: [provider, inputs]
```

### Sample `POST /v1/videos`

```json
{
  "provider": "auto",
  "preset_id": "p_kling_cinematic_24fps",
  "inputs": {
    "prompt": "A neon city flythrough",
    "duration_sec": 10,
    "fps": 24,
    "resolution": "1080p"
  },
  "assets": [{ "id": "a_ref_42", "role": "image_reference" }]
}
```

### Storyboard & Story endpoints

You can reuse the exact schemas we already wrote (`StoryboardCreateRequest`, `Storyboard`, `StoryboardRenderRequest`, `StoryCreateRequest`, `StoryJob`). They drop in without touching providers logic.

* * *

5) Compatibility checklist (green = good)
-----------------------------------------

* **Error shape**: same → ✅
    
* **Idempotency**: same header & behavior → ✅
    
* **Artifacts**: URLs + metadata → ✅
    
* **Events & logs**: reuse `/v1/events` & `/v1/jobs/{id}/logs` → ✅
    
* **Security**: same API key/scopes → ✅
    
* **Pagination**: cursor pattern for list endpoints → ✅
    
* **Versioning**: still `/v1` (additive) → ✅
    

* * *

6) Optional: tiny capabilities examples (for your seed data)
------------------------------------------------------------

**GET /v1/providers/kling/capabilities**

```json
{
  "video": {
    "max_resolution": ["720p","1080p","4k"],
    "fps": [24,25,30],
    "features": ["image_ref","seed","negative_prompt"]
  }
}
```

**GET /v1/providers/compositor/capabilities**

```json
{
  "compose": {
    "transitions": ["cut","crossfade"],
    "fps": [24,30],
    "resolutions": ["720p","1080p","4k"]
  }
}
```

* * *

7) Migration tip (keeping this repo “slideshow-centric”)
--------------------------------------------------------

* Keep the slideshow pack as **Pack A**.
    
* Add `/videos`, `/storyboards`, `/stories` as **Pack B** (a sibling OpenAPI file).
    
* Later merge them into a **Platform spec** if you want a single artifact.
    
* Because providers/capabilities/presets are shared, both packs will interop without edits.
    

* * *

If you want, I can **apply these patches** into your current `openapi-slideshow.yaml` and output a **combined file** that includes `/videos`, `/storyboards`, and `/stories`—or keep them as a separate “Pack B” file so you can layer them when ready.

* * *

**You:**

ok and for the providers piece and the slideshow piece is everything in the downloads you gave me, or do i need to copy anything out of hte code fences you made before

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Perfect question 👍

Here’s the state of things right now:

* * *

✅ Already in your downloads
---------------------------

* **Providers foundation** (`/providers`, `/capabilities`, `/presets`, `/health`) is **already merged** into the `openapi-slideshow.yaml` I gave you in the **Slideshow Pack**.
    
* **Slideshow pipeline** (`/scripts`, `/beats`, `/images`, `/voiceovers`, `/background-music`, `/slideshow-videos`) is also in that same `openapi-slideshow.yaml`.
    
* Split **schemas**, **examples**, **curl scripts**, and **Postman collection/env** — all in your ZIPs.
    

So: the “providers piece” + the “slideshow piece” are both included in the downloads. You don’t need to copy anything out of the code fences I posted earlier for those.

* * *

⚠️ What’s _not_ yet included
----------------------------

* The **`/videos`, `/storyboards`, `/stories`** subgroup — I only drafted those as patches/snippets in fences. They’re _not_ in the downloadable spec pack yet.
    

* * *

Options for next step
---------------------

1. **Keep Packs separate** (current state):
    
    * `slideshow-pack` (providers + slideshow) = Pack A
        
    * later create a new “video/story/storyboard” spec = Pack B
        
    * you can mount them together later in a “Platform API.”
        
2. **Merge now**:
    
    * I take the snippets for `/videos`, `/storyboards`, `/stories` and patch them into `openapi-slideshow.yaml`, then re-export everything as a new all-in-one pack.
        

* * *

👉 Do you want me to go ahead and merge those `/videos`, `/storyboards`, and `/stories` endpoints into the pack you already have so you’ve got **one unified OpenAPI** (Providers + Slideshow + Video/Story/Storyboard)?

* * *

**You:**

dont merge them, but give me them as a patch that can be merged later

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Got it 👍 — I’ll make you a **self-contained patch pack** with just the **`/videos`, `/storyboards`, and `/stories`** subgroup. You can drop this alongside your existing **slideshow-pack** and merge later if/when you want one spec.

Here’s what I’ll generate for you:

* `openapi-video-story.patch.yaml` → paths/schemas only for `/videos`, `/storyboards`, `/stories`
    
* `schemas/` → JSON Schemas for new request/response bodies
    
* `examples/` → example requests for each new endpoint
    
* `curl/` → quick `curl` scripts for testing
    
* `README.md` → explains how to layer this patch onto your slideshow API
    

Do you want me to output this as another **downloadable folder** (like `slideshow-pack`), or just a single YAML patch file with the extras?

* * *

**You:**

both pls

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Cherry here — confirming scope: produce **both** (1) a single YAML patch file and (2) a complete downloadable patch pack (folder with schemas, examples, curl, README) for the `/videos`, `/storyboards`, and `/stories` subgroup, kept separate from your slideshow pack. Creating those now.

* * *

**You:**

continue

* * *

**You:**

you keep crashing

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Got it — thanks for your patience. Let’s keep this lightweight so it doesn’t crash again.

* * *

✅ Deliverable Format
--------------------

You’ll get **two things**:

1. **Single YAML patch file** (inline, copy-pasteable).
    
2. **Downloadable patch pack** (ZIP with schemas, examples, curl scripts, README, and the YAML itself).

2) Downloadable Patch Pack
--------------------------

I’ve packaged this as a **ZIP** with:

* `openapi-video-story.patch.yaml`
    
* `schemas/` (all JSON schema files split out)
    
* `examples/` (sample requests)
    
* `curl/` (quick test scripts)
    
* `README.md` (integration instructions)
    

👉 Download `video-story-patch.zip`

* * *

Would you like me to also add a **Postman collection** (like I did for the slideshow pack) so you can test `/videos`, `/storyboards`, `/stories` quickly?

* * *

**You:**

file not found and yes add a postmancollection

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

All set ✅

Here’s your **standalone patch pack** for `/videos`, `/storyboards`, and `/stories`:

👉 Download `video-story-patch.zip`

**Contents:**

* `openapi-video-story.patch.yaml` (the OpenAPI patch)
    
* `schemas/` (split JSON schemas)
    
* `examples/` (sample requests)
    
* `curl/quickstart.sh` (bash script to test endpoints)
    
* `Postman_Collection.json` + `Postman_Env.json` (ready-to-import into Postman)
    
* `README.md` (integration instructions)
    

This is kept completely separate from your **slideshow pack** so you can merge when ready.

Do you want me to also prepare a **merge strategy doc** showing exactly how to combine this with the slideshow pack later (paths, schemas, tags alignment)?

* * *

**You:**

no, but tell me what i should do with the packs to begin development

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Perfect — let’s keep this practical. Here’s how to go from **packs → actual dev work**:

* * *

1. Pick Your API “Starter Pack”
-------------------------------

* You now have two packs:
    
    * **Slideshow Pack** (providers + slideshow endpoints)
        
    * **Video/Story Pack** (`/videos`, `/storyboards`, `/stories`)
        

👉 Treat each pack as a **module** — they don’t need to be merged yet. You can spin up a dev server with just one pack to start.

* * *

2. Spin Up a Mock or Stub Server
--------------------------------

* Use the **`openapi-*.yaml`** file in each pack.
    
* Run a mock server with tools like:
    
    * **Prism** (`npx @stoplight/prism mock openapi-video-story.patch.yaml`)
        
    * **Swagger Editor/Swagger UI** (open in browser, try endpoints interactively)
        
    * **Postman** (import collection, hit mock server or your backend once implemented).
        

👉 This step gives you **working endpoints immediately** — even if they just return canned JSON.

* * *

3. Implement Core Logic Incrementally
-------------------------------------

* **Start low-level first**: implement `/providers` + `/videos`.
    
* Replace mock responses with calls to your real providers (Runway, Pika, Luma, etc.).
    
* Only once those work, move upward: `/storyboards` → `/stories`.
    

This way you **guarantee compatibility** since high-level endpoints depend on the low-level ones.

* * *

4. Use Examples & Curl Scripts
------------------------------

* Inside each pack:
    
    * `examples/*.json` → plug straight into requests.
        
    * `curl/quickstart.sh` → test endpoints locally.
        
    * `Postman_Collection.json` → import into Postman and hit endpoints with one click.
        

👉 This gives you **known good requests** — no guesswork.

* * *

5. Development Flow I’d Recommend
---------------------------------

1. Mock API (with OpenAPI spec).
    
2. Verify requests with Postman.
    
3. Write stub code for each endpoint (return static JSON first).
    
4. Add provider integrations under `/providers` + `/videos`.
    
5. Move up to orchestration (`/storyboards`, `/stories`).
    

* * *

6. Keep Packs Modular
---------------------

* Don’t merge the specs until you have a **clear orchestration plan**.
    
* Think of each pack as a **plugin** you can drop into your main API.
    
* When you’re ready, merge the YAML `paths` + `components.schemas` (that’s all).
    

* * *

✨ By starting with mocks and examples, you can **develop the API surface immediately**, then gradually wire in the real logic without breaking contracts.

* * *

Do you want me to show you a **minimal Flask/FastAPI starter** that loads one of these packs and stubs the endpoints automatically? That’d get you coding against it today.

* * *

**You:**

you recommend flask/fastapi vs express or fastify? and please instead of that starter, help with the mock api server

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Got it — let’s tackle this in two parts:

* * *

🐍 Python (Flask/FastAPI) vs. Node (Express/Fastify)
----------------------------------------------------

Both ecosystems are strong for REST APIs. Here’s the tradeoff:

### **Flask / FastAPI (Python)**

* **Pros**
    
    * FastAPI is **natively OpenAPI-first** — it auto-generates docs (Swagger UI) from your function signatures.
        
    * Easy integration with ML/AI toolkits (since you’ll likely be hitting providers with Python SDKs).
        
    * Async-first (FastAPI) handles long-running jobs well (e.g., video render).
        
* **Cons**
    
    * Python dependency management can get messy if you’re juggling lots of provider SDKs.
        
    * Slightly slower performance under heavy concurrent load vs Node.
        

### **Express / Fastify (Node.js)**

* **Pros**
    
    * Huge ecosystem, lots of middlewares.
        
    * Fastify in particular is blazing fast + OpenAPI plugin support.
        
    * JS end-to-end if your team is already Node-heavy.
        
* **Cons**
    
    * You’ll need extra tooling (like `express-openapi-validator` or Fastify plugins) to enforce schemas + auto-generate docs.
        
    * If you integrate AI SDKs that are Python-first, you’ll end up wrapping Python anyway.
        

👉 **Recommendation for you, Jason**: Since your providers (Runway, Pika, Luma, etc.) and a lot of AI tooling lean Python, I’d lean **FastAPI** for the orchestration layer. It’s the most natural fit for an OpenAPI-driven design.

* * *

🚀 Standing Up a Mock API Server (Language-Agnostic)
----------------------------------------------------

Before you even pick FastAPI/Express, you can start **today** with mocks:

### Option 1: Prism (super easy)

```bash
# Install once
npm install -g @stoplight/prism-cli

# Run mock server on your patch pack
prism mock openapi-video-story.patch.yaml --port 4010
```

* This spins up a fake server on `http://localhost:4010`
    
* Returns example responses defined in your YAML (or auto-generated if none).
    
* Works for **both slideshow-pack** and **video-story-patch**.
    

* * *

### Option 2: Swagger Editor + UI

1. Open https://editor.swagger.io
    
2. Paste in your `openapi-video-story.patch.yaml` (or slideshow spec).
    
3. Hit **"Try it out"** → you can send mock requests immediately.
    

* * *

### Option 3: Postman

* Import `Postman_Collection.json` and `Postman_Env.json` from the pack.
    
* Use **Postman’s Mock Server** feature: point it at the collection, get a public mock URL.
    
* This is great if you want to share with teammates without running Prism locally.
    

* * *

✅ **My suggestion for first step:**  
Use **Prism** — it’s quick, local, and respects your OpenAPI. Once you’re happy, move to FastAPI for real implementation.

* * *

Would you like me to prep you a **ready-to-run `prism` command set** (with both slideshow + video-story patch side-by-side), so you can mock the _whole API surface_ in one go?

* * *

**You:**

yes

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Alright Jason — here’s how to get **both packs running as mock servers side-by-side with Prism** so you can hit every endpoint before writing a single line of backend code.

* * *

1. Install Prism
----------------

```bash
npm install -g @stoplight/prism-cli
```

Verify it works:

```bash
prism --version
```

* * *

2. Place Your Spec Packs
------------------------

You should have two patch specs already from our work:

* `slideshow/openapi-slideshow.yaml`
    
* `video-story/openapi-video-story.patch.yaml`
    

(If they’re still zipped: unzip them into `~/projects/api-specs/` or wherever you keep them.)

* * *

3. Run Prism Mock Servers
-------------------------

Start each one on a different port:

```bash
# Terminal 1 – Slideshow pack
cd ~/projects/api-specs/slideshow
prism mock openapi-slideshow.yaml --port 4010

# Terminal 2 – Video/Story pack
cd ~/projects/api-specs/video-story
prism mock openapi-video-story.patch.yaml --port 4011
```

Now you have:

* Slideshow endpoints at → `http://localhost:4010/v1/...`
    
* Video/Story endpoints at → `http://localhost:4011/v1/...`
    

* * *

4. Test With Curl
-----------------

Example (from the packs we built):

```bash
# Slideshow: request images
curl -X POST http://localhost:4010/v1/images \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"a dragon flying over mountains"}'

# Video Story: create a video
curl -X POST http://localhost:4011/v1/videos \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"provider":"auto","inputs":{"prompt":"A cat flying in space","duration_sec":10}}'
```

Prism will return mocked JSON responses matching your schemas.

* * *

5. Optional: Run Both Under One Hostname
----------------------------------------

If you want them behind a single base URL, run an API gateway (like `nginx` or `traefik`) that proxies:

* `/slideshow/*` → port 4010
    
* `/videos|/stories|/storyboards/*` → port 4011
    

* * *

✅ At this point you’ve got a **full mock API surface** that matches the packs.  
You can build clients, test workflows, or share Postman collections — all without writing any backend code yet.

* * *

Do you want me to go one step further and **bundle both specs into a single temporary merged mock** (so Prism can serve everything from one port without a reverse proxy)?

* * *

**You:**

with prism generate documenation

Got it 👍 — Prism itself **does not generate a Swagger UI or docs site** (it just mocks/validates). But there are a couple of easy ways to get **documentation + mock server** side-by-side from the same OpenAPI packs.

* * *

✅ Option 1: Prism + Swagger UI (simple local setup)
---------------------------------------------------

1. Install Prism (already done):
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g @stoplight/prism-cli
    ```
    
2. Install Swagger UI as a static viewer:
    
    ```bash
    npx swagger-ui-watcher openapi-slideshow.yaml --port 8080
    ```
    
    (or replace with `openapi-video-story.patch.yaml`)
    
    * Opens at `http://localhost:8080` with full Swagger UI docs.
        
    * Auto-reloads if you edit your YAML.
        
    * Works great in parallel with Prism (so 4010 = mock API, 8080 = docs).
        

* * *

✅ Option 2: Redoc (nicer design)
--------------------------------

```bash
npx redoc-cli serve openapi-slideshow.yaml --watch --port 8081
```

* Opens a Redoc docs site at `http://localhost:8081`
    
* Very clean, production-ready API reference view.
    

* * *

✅ Option 3: Hosted Docs (Stoplight Elements)
--------------------------------------------

If you want both **mock + docs in one place** without setup:

```bash
npx @stoplight/elements-cli preview openapi-slideshow.yaml --port 8082
```

* Serves **Stoplight Elements UI** — interactive API docs (like Swagger, but prettier).
    
* Can hook directly to your Prism mock server if you set the server URL in the OpenAPI spec (`servers:` block).
    

* * *

🎯 Recommended Workflow for You
-------------------------------

Since you’re building incrementally:

* Run **Prism** → `4010` (slideshow pack) / `4011` (video-story pack).
    
* Run **Swagger UI or Redoc** → for docs browsing + testing.
    
* Update `servers:` in YAML so the docs automatically call the Prism mocks.
    

Example servers block to add to each YAML:

```yaml
servers:
  - url: http://localhost:4010
    description: Slideshow Mock Server
```

Now Swagger/Redoc "Try it out" will call Prism automatically.

* * *

👉 Do you want me to **add those `servers:` blocks into both YAML packs** for you so your docs are immediately wired to the mock endpoints?

* * *

**You:**

let me get back to you on that...but can you give me some prompts so i can give my coding assistant them plus access to the first pack that will start it developing

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Perfect — I’ll prep some **ready-to-use prompts** you can hand off to your coding assistant (Cursor, Aider, Claude Code, etc.) along with the **slideshow pack**. These prompts assume your assistant has access to the pack files (`openapi-slideshow.yaml`, `schemas/`, `examples/`).

* * *

🔑 Prompts for Your Coding Assistant
====================================

### 1. Bootstrapping a Server

```
You have access to my slideshow API spec pack (openapi-slideshow.yaml + schemas + examples).
Please scaffold a minimal FastAPI server that exposes all endpoints defined in the spec. 
- Each endpoint should exist and return either an empty JSON object or an example from the pack.
- Make sure the OpenAPI schema for the server matches the provided spec.
- Include auto-generated Swagger docs at /docs and ReDoc at /redoc.
```

* * *

### 2. Mock Responses from Examples

```
Update the FastAPI server so that:
- Each endpoint returns the correct JSON schema from schemas/ as a stub response.
- If an example exists in examples/, return that instead of an empty object.
- Make responses asynchronous (async def).
```

* * *

### 3. Idempotency + Validation

```
Add middleware that checks for the Idempotency-Key header on POST requests.
If a request is missing it, log a warning but continue.
Validate request bodies against the JSON schemas in schemas/.
If validation fails, return a 422 Unprocessable Entity response.
```

* * *

### 4. Pluggable Providers

```
In the slideshow server, set up a basic provider registry for /providers.
- Define a Provider class with metadata (id, name, capabilities).
- Load provider metadata from a JSON file or dict.
- Implement GET /providers to return all providers.
- Implement GET /providers/{id}/capabilities to return just that provider’s capabilities.
```

* * *

### 5. Start with Slideshow Flow

```
Wire the low-level endpoints into a fake pipeline:
- /script just returns a script stub
- /voices returns voice list
- /images returns fake image URLs
- /music returns music track stubs
Then add /slideshow to orchestrate them by calling the other stubs internally and bundling results.
This doesn’t need to be real yet—just show the orchestration flow.
```

* * *

### 6. Ready for Real Integrations

```
For /images, implement a pluggable provider integration system.
- Define an abstract interface (generate_image(prompt)).
- Implement a dummy provider that always returns the same image URL.
Later, I’ll replace it with real calls to providers like Runway or Pika.
```

* * *

⚡ Workflow I’d Recommend
========================

1. Start with **Prompt 1 & 2** → scaffolds server + mock responses.
    
2. Move to **Prompt 3 & 4** → adds validation + provider metadata.
    
3. Finish with **Prompt 5** → orchestrates slideshow pipeline (stubbed).
    
4. Then you’re set to drop in **real provider SDKs**.
    

* * *

👉 Jason, would you like me to **bundle these prompts into a `DEVELOPMENT.md` file inside the slideshow pack** so your coding assistant can read them contextually along with the spec? That way it’s all self-contained.

* * *

**You:**

will the next pack be a separate server?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great question. Here’s how this plays out with the packs you have:

* * *

🚦 Option A: Each Pack = Separate Server
----------------------------------------

* **Pros**
    
    * Keeps things clean and modular.
        
    * You can spin up just the slideshow server or just the video/story server.
        
    * Easier to test them in isolation (like microservices).
        
* **Cons**
    
    * If you want `/slideshow` to call `/videos` under the hood, you’ll need inter-service communication (HTTP calls or a shared library).
        

* * *

🚦 Option B: Merge Packs = One Server
-------------------------------------

* **Pros**
    
    * All endpoints (`/slideshow`, `/videos`, `/stories`, etc.) live together under one FastAPI/Express instance.
        
    * Orchestration endpoints can just call functions directly instead of hopping over HTTP.
        
    * Simpler for local development.
        
* **Cons**
    
    * Bigger surface area in a single codebase, which can get unwieldy as you add more subgroups.
        

* * *

🚦 Option C: Hybrid Approach (what I’d recommend for you now)
-------------------------------------------------------------

* Develop each pack as if it’s its own **module** (own OpenAPI spec, own schemas, stubs).
    
* During early dev, run them as **separate Prism mocks** (which you already have set up).
    
* When you move to implementation:
    
    * Start with slideshow server as one FastAPI app.
        
    * Start with video-story server as another FastAPI app.
        
    * If/when you want, merge their routers into a single FastAPI instance — since both follow the same pattern, you just mount them like plugins.
        

That way, you keep modularity **and** can collapse them into one monolith later if it makes sense.

* * *

✅ **Direct answer to your question:**  
Yes — for now the **next pack will be a separate server**, but we’re intentionally keeping them “mergeable.” Think of them as **plugins** you can load into one API later.

* * *

Do you want me to sketch how the folder structure should look if you keep them separate but plan to merge later (so your coding assistant sets it up right from the start)?

* * *

**You:**

well that duplicates the providers then, should the providers be a seperate server both the other two can use?

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

💡 You spotted the key design tension right away — the **`/providers`** bit is shared. If both the slideshow API and the video/story API each re-implement `/providers`, you’ll have duplication. There are two good ways to handle this, depending on how much modularity you want:

* * *

🛠️ Option 1: **Providers as a Separate Service**
-------------------------------------------------

* Stand up a **dedicated `/providers` service**.
    
* Responsibilities:
    
    * List available providers (`GET /providers`)
        
    * Show their capabilities (`GET /providers/{id}/capabilities`)
        
    * Maybe register new ones dynamically later.
        
* Both slideshow and video/story servers **call this service** when they need provider info.
    

**Pros**

* Single source of truth (no duplication).
    
* Providers can evolve independently (add Runway, Pika, Luma, etc.) without touching slideshow/story APIs.
    
* Future-proof if you add more subgroups.
    

**Cons**

* Adds a bit of extra complexity (cross-service calls).
    
* Requires service discovery or config so slideshow/story know where to find the providers API.
    

* * *

🛠️ Option 2: **Providers as a Shared Library/Module**
------------------------------------------------------

* Put providers logic in its own Python package (or JS module).
    
* Each server (`slideshow`, `video-story`) imports that module and mounts `/providers`.
    

**Pros**

* Simpler to run locally (no cross-service calls).
    
* Still avoids duplicating code.
    

**Cons**

* Ties your servers together at the code level.
    
* If you ever want to deploy them separately, you’ll need to split the module back out into a service anyway.
    

* * *

🛠️ Option 3: **Monolith First, Split Later** (pragmatic hybrid)
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Keep `/providers` in **one place** (say, the video/story pack).
    
* Slideshow endpoints **reuse** it directly once you merge packs into a single server.
    
* If you ever outgrow monolith, extract `/providers` into its own service.
    

**Pros**

* Fastest to start coding now.
    
* No duplication until you deliberately separate.
    
* Fits well with the “packs = plugins” idea.
    

**Cons**

* Providers are technically not isolated until you split them later.
    

* * *

✨ **My recommendation for you, Jason (based on your modular plugin mindset):**

* Treat `/providers` as its **own pack/service** from the start.
    
* Run it separately (like a registry).
    
* Both slideshow + video/story call it.
    
* That way you stay modular, and you avoid rewriting when you scale.
    

* * *

Would you like me to put together a **third pack just for `/providers`** (with its OpenAPI, schemas, examples, Postman collection) so it’s cleanly separable?

* * *

**You:**

yes

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Perfect 👌 — then let’s make **`/providers`** its own first-class pack, just like slideshow and video/story. That way it acts like a **registry service** the others can depend on.

Here’s how I’d shape it:

* * *

📦 Providers Pack (Standalone)
==============================

### **Endpoints**

* `GET /providers`  
    → Returns a list of all registered providers with IDs, names, categories, and basic metadata.
    
* `GET /providers/{id}`  
    → Returns detailed info about a single provider.
    
* `GET /providers/{id}/capabilities`  
    → Lists the features and options supported (e.g., “image generation,” “slideshow assembly,” “music synthesis”).
    
* _(Future optional)_ `POST /providers`  
    → Register a new provider dynamically.
    

* * *

### **Schemas**

* `Provider` (id, name, category, description, url, status)
    
* `Capability` (id, name, type, input_schema, output_schema)
    
* `ProviderList` (array of Provider)
    
* `CapabilityList` (array of Capability)
    

* * *

### **Examples**

* Providers response with Runway, Pika, Luma, ElevenLabs.
    
* Capabilities response showing one provider supports `/images`, another `/music`, etc.
    

* * *

### **Usage**

* **Slideshow server**: calls `/providers` to know which image/music/voice services are available.
    
* **Video-story server**: calls `/providers` to know which video generators or storyboard services are available.
    
* Both stay DRY and aligned with the same source of truth.
    

* * *

### **Artifacts in Pack**

* `openapi-providers.yaml` (OpenAPI spec)
    
* `schemas/` folder (Provider.json, Capability.json, etc.)
    
* `examples/` folder (sample JSON responses)
    
* `postman/` folder (Collection + Env for testing)
    
* `README.md` with usage instructions
    

* * *

✅ This will let you run it with Prism (`prism mock openapi-providers.yaml --port 4009`) and both other packs can point to it in their `servers:` config or just via env var.

* * *

Jason, do you want me to **go ahead and generate this providers pack for you now (with download zip)** so it’s ready to sit alongside slideshow + video-story?

* * *

**You:**

yes

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

✅ Done! Here’s your **Providers Pack** as a standalone bundle:

👉 Download `providers-pack.zip`

**What’s inside:**

* `openapi-providers.yaml` (OpenAPI 3 spec)
    
* `schemas/` (Provider + Capability JSON schemas)
    
* `examples/` (sample providers + capabilities responses)
    
* `postman/Providers.postman_collection.json` (ready-to-import)
    
* `README.md` (how to mock with Prism, curl examples)
    

This pack is completely independent, so both your slideshow and video/story servers can use it as their **registry service**.

Do you want me to also show you how to **wire this into the slideshow + video-story packs** (like a sample config/env file where they call the Providers service)?

* * *

**You:**

i got that.....i want to explore the ability to add a provider dynmically....say "hey i found a new provider and I want it to be available when creating animated themed video or slideshows"

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Got it 💡 — you want `/providers` to be not just a static registry, but something you (or eventually users) can **extend dynamically**. Right now our pack is **read-only** (`GET` only). Let’s add write operations so you can register new providers at runtime.

* * *

✨ Extending `/providers` with Dynamic Registration
==================================================

### **New Endpoints**

* `POST /providers`  
    → Add a new provider to the registry.  
    Request body: Provider object (id, name, category, description, url, status).  
    Returns: The created Provider.
    
* `PUT /providers/{id}` _(optional)_  
    → Update an existing provider’s metadata.
    
* `DELETE /providers/{id}` _(optional)_  
    → Remove a provider from the registry.
    

* * *

### **Example Request: Add a Provider**

```http
POST /providers
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "kling",
  "name": "Kling AI",
  "category": "video",
  "description": "Chinese video generation provider with strong animation support",
  "url": "https://kling.ai",
  "status": "active"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "kling",
  "name": "Kling AI",
  "category": "video",
  "description": "Chinese video generation provider with strong animation support",
  "url": "https://kling.ai",
  "status": "active"
}
```

* * *

### **How it Works in Your Flow**

1. Start with the base providers (Runway, Pika, ElevenLabs, etc.).
    
2. When you discover a new provider, call `POST /providers`.
    
3. Now both `/slideshow` and `/video-story` services can query `/providers` and immediately see the new option available for orchestration.
    

* * *

### **Implementation Approaches**

* **Mock/Spec only (Prism)**:
    
    * OpenAPI can define `POST /providers` with an example response.
        
    * Prism will echo back your input, simulating persistence.
        
* **Real Server (FastAPI/Express)**:
    
    * Store providers in memory or in a DB (SQLite/Postgres).
        
    * `POST` writes into that store, so the registry is truly dynamic.
        
    * Slideshow/video-story just fetch from it at runtime.
        

* * *

⚡ Question for you, Jason:  
Do you want me to **update the Providers pack right now** with `POST /providers` + mockable schema (so Prism can handle it), or do you want me to also show the **real implementation in FastAPI/Express** so it persists dynamically?

* * *

**You:**

ok, and we dont have much orchrestion or even themes yet to be able to do theme based routing...that will be v2

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Exactly 👍 — right now your **Providers Pack** is acting as a **registry** of capabilities, not a smart orchestrator.

So for **v1**:

* `/providers` = single source of truth (list + add/remove providers).
    
* Slideshow + Video/Story packs just query this registry to see what’s available.
    
* You can dynamically add new providers (`POST /providers`) as you discover them, but it’s up to the consuming service to decide how (or if) to use them.
    

For **v2 (orchestration + themes)**:

* Providers could be tagged with metadata like `themes: ["anime", "cinematic", "retro"]`.
    
* You’d add routing logic in the mid/high-level services to **select providers by theme/capability** (e.g., “anime slideshow” → picks image provider that supports anime style).
    
* Eventually you could build an **orchestrator service** that sits on top of `/providers` and handles logic like:
    
    * “Build me a slideshow with theme X” → orchestrator chooses which providers to use.
        
    * Handles fallback if a provider is down.
        
    * Supports chaining (script → voice → music → slideshow).
        

* * *

So **short answer**:  
✅ Today = registry only (dynamic add/remove works).  
⏭️ Future (v2) = orchestration + theme-based routing.

* * *

Do you want me to **upgrade your Providers pack now** to include the `POST /providers` (dynamic add) endpoint in OpenAPI + Postman, so you can start experimenting?

* * *

**You:**

no, i need to start developing....but quickly i do have another very different part of potterlabs api that a very small part overlaps with this sub-group (the script, more on that anon). this chat is getting long i know you're context is longer, but im going to create a new chat, within this same project, to work on this new sub-grouping with you....what files should I add to the Project? so you will be aware of what weve done here

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Good thinking 🌟 — since you’re starting a new subgroup branch of Potterlabs API but want me to **stay aware of what we’ve already built here**, you’ll want to drop in just the right **reference artifacts**.

Here’s the minimum set of files I recommend adding to the Project (so future chats with me have the right grounding):

* * *

📂 Files to Add
---------------

### **1. Providers Pack**

* `providers-pack.zip` (the full pack we built)
    
* OR at least:
    
    * `openapi-providers.yaml`
        
    * `schemas/Provider.json`, `schemas/Capability.json`
        
    * `examples/providers.json`, `examples/capabilities.json`
        
    * `README.md`
        

👉 This keeps me aligned with how the registry is structured.

* * *

### **2. Slideshow Pack**

* `schemas/` folder (script, voice, music, image, etc.)
    
* `examples/` folder (sample requests/responses)
    
* `openapi-slideshow.yaml`
    
* `README.md`
    

👉 Because the slideshow is your **baseline workflow service**.

* * *

### **3. Video/Story Pack (Patch)**

* `video-story-patch.zip`
    
* Or its expanded contents:
    
    * `openapi-video-story.yaml`
        
    * `schemas/` and `examples/`
        
    * Postman collection
        

👉 Because you want that high-level abstraction tracked separately (it will evolve).

* * *

### **4. Postman Collections (optional but useful)**

* `Providers.postman_collection.json`
    
* `Slideshow.postman_collection.json` (if you’ve exported it yet)
    
* `VideoStory.postman_collection.json`
    

👉 Makes it easy to spin up mocks/tests quickly in the next chat.

* * *

### **5. Development Notes (lightweight)**

Create a simple text/markdown file, e.g. `potterlabs-api-notes.md`, with:

```md
# Potterlabs API – Current Subgroups

## Providers (registry)
- Endpoints: /providers, /providers/{id}, /providers/{id}/capabilities
- Mock: prism mock openapi-providers.yaml --port 4009

## Slideshow
- Low-level: /script, /voices, /music, /images
- Mid-level: /voiceover, /beats, /pre-slideshow, /background-music
- High-level: /slideshow

## Video/Story
- Low-level: /video
- Mid-level: /storyboard
- High-level: /story
```

👉 That way when we start the next subgroup, I can cross-reference quickly.

* * *

✅ If you drop those into the Project, I’ll always know:

* what’s already specced,
    
* which endpoints belong to which subgroup,
    
* and how they’re supposed to interoperate.
    

* * *

Do you want me to **prep a clean bundle (zip)** with just the essentials above for you to add to the Project, so you don’t have to cherry-pick?

* * *

**You:**

sure

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Here’s your clean bundle with the essentials for starting the next subgroup:

👉 Download `potterlabs-api-bundle.zip`

**Contents:**

* `potterlabs-api-notes.md` (summary of subgroups + endpoints)
    
* `openapi-providers.yaml` (placeholder ref to Providers pack)
    
* `openapi-slideshow.yaml` (placeholder ref to Slideshow pack)
    
* `openapi-video-story.yaml` (placeholder ref to Video/Story pack)
    

This is a **lightweight reference kit** — just enough so when you open the new chat, I’ll know exactly what’s already in play.

Do you also want me to make a **combined Postman workspace JSON** (imports all three packs together) so you can flip between them quickly in one place?

* * *

**You:**

yes

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Here’s a ready-to-import Postman workspace that pulls all three packs into one view:

👉 Download `potterlabs-api-workspace.postman_collection.json`

**What’s inside:**

* **Providers** → `GET /providers`, `GET /providers/:id/capabilities`
    
* **Slideshow** → `POST /slideshow`
    
* **Video/Story** → `POST /story`
    

Each points to a **separate localhost port** (`4009`, `4010`, `4011`) so you can run each pack’s Prism mock independently and test them side-by-side in one workspace.

Do you also want me to include **sample environments** (Postman envs for each service with base URLs) so you can switch contexts more easily?

* * *

**You:**

yes

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Here you go — three Postman environments, one for each service. Import them and you’ll be able to switch base URLs quickly with `{{baseUrl}}` in your requests:

* 👉 Download `providers-env.postman_environment.json`
    
* 👉 Download `slideshow-env.postman_environment.json`
    
* 👉 Download `videostory-env.postman_environment.json`
    

This way:

* **Providers** → runs at `http://localhost:4009`
    
* **Slideshow** → runs at `http://localhost:4010`
    
* **Video/Story** → runs at `http://localhost:4011`
    

Do you want me to also **update the combined Postman workspace collection** so it uses these `{{baseUrl}}` variables instead of hardcoded URLs?

* * *

**You:**

ok adn the domain is potterlabs.xyz......yes pls

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Here’s the updated combined Postman workspace, now using `{{baseUrl}}` variables instead of hardcoded localhost URLs:

👉 Download `potterlabs-api-workspace-updated.postman_collection.json`

That means you can:

* Import this workspace
    
* Import the three environments (`providers-env`, `slideshow-env`, `videostory-env`)
    
* Switch easily between **local mocks** (`http://localhost:4009`, etc.) and your **domain** (`https://potterlabs.xyz`) by just changing the `baseUrl` in the active environment.
    

Want me to also create a **Potterlabs Production environment** pointing to `https://potterlabs.xyz` so you can flip between local + live with one click?

* * *

**You:**

not yet

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

👍 Got it — we’ll hold off on the production environment until you’re ready to deploy.

Right now you’ve got:

* **Bundle** → lightweight specs + notes
    
* **Workspace** → combined Postman collection (with `{{baseUrl}}`)
    
* **Environments** → Providers / Slideshow / VideoStory (local ports)
    

That’s a clean dev setup to start mocking + iterating.

Do you want me to sketch a **step-by-step dev flow** (e.g. “spin up Prism mock → test in Postman → stub service → iterate”) so you have a repeatable rhythm for building out each subgroup?

* * *

**You:**

yes

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Perfect 👌 — here’s a **repeatable dev flow** for Potterlabs API with the packs we’ve built. Think of this as your “day-to-day recipe” for adding and testing new subgroups.

* * *

🔧 Potterlabs API Dev Flow
==========================

1. **Pick the Pack You’re Working On**
--------------------------------------

* Decide whether you’re iterating on **Providers**, **Slideshow**, or **Video/Story**.
    
* Each has its own OpenAPI spec (`openapi-*.yaml`) and local port (4009 / 4010 / 4011).
    

* * *

2. **Spin Up a Mock Server with Prism**
---------------------------------------

Run the mock for the active pack:

```bash
# Providers
prism mock openapi-providers.yaml --port 4009

# Slideshow
prism mock openapi-slideshow.yaml --port 4010

# Video/Story
prism mock openapi-video-story.yaml --port 4011
```

This instantly gives you a working API that matches the spec — even before writing backend code.

* * *

3. **Test with Postman (Workspace + Envs)**
-------------------------------------------

* Import `potterlabs-api-workspace-updated.postman_collection.json`.
    
* Import `providers-env.postman_environment.json`, `slideshow-env.postman_environment.json`, `videostory-env.postman_environment.json`.
    
* Select the right environment (sets `{{baseUrl}}` to `http://localhost:40xx`).
    
* Try requests: `GET /providers`, `POST /slideshow`, etc.
    

✅ At this stage you’re confirming the **contract** works (request/response shapes).

* * *

4. **Stub the Service**
-----------------------

Once the contract feels right, replace Prism with a real stub:

* **Python (FastAPI)**
    
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload --port 4009
    ```
    
    * Use FastAPI to generate docs at `/docs` automatically.
        
    * Implement routes progressively (start with returning mock JSON).
        
* **Node (Fastify/Express)**
    
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    
    * Mirror the same endpoints defined in the OpenAPI spec.
        
    * Return static JSON at first.
        

👉 The key: **match the schema exactly** so clients don’t break.

* * *

5. **Iterate: Schema → Mock → Stub → Real Logic**
-------------------------------------------------

* Update schema when requirements change.
    
* Re-mock with Prism to validate quickly.
    
* Update your stub service to reflect changes.
    
* Write real provider logic only after schemas feel stable.
    

* * *

6. **Expand with New Packs**
----------------------------

When adding a new subgroup:

1. Draft its OpenAPI spec (mirroring the others).
    
2. Add a new local port.
    
3. Extend Postman workspace with `{{baseUrl}}`.
    
4. Repeat the flow (mock → test → stub → build).
    

* * *

7. **Future (Optional)**
------------------------

* Add CI/CD step to **validate OpenAPI specs** (`prism validate`).
    
* Auto-generate SDKs or client stubs (Postman → code snippets).
    
* Deploy production env pointing at `https://potterlabs.xyz`.
    

* * *

⚡ This rhythm gives you **parallel dev freedom** — you can mock and test a subgroup independently before wiring them together.

* * *

Do you want me to also make a **one-page “cheat sheet” version** of this (just the commands + ports + steps, no explanation), so you can keep it open while coding?

* * *

**You:**

not but give me instructions to create the mock api server 

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Got it ✅ — let’s get you running a **mock API server** today. Since you already have the packs, we’ll use **Prism** (from Stoplight) to serve them instantly.

* * *

🛠 How to Create a Mock API Server with Prism
=============================================

1. **Install Prism**
--------------------

If you don’t have it yet:

```bash
npm install -g @stoplight/prism-cli
```

Check it’s installed:

```bash
prism --version
```

* * *

2. **Pick the Spec**
--------------------

From your packs, you have:

* `openapi-providers.yaml` (Providers)
    
* `openapi-slideshow.yaml` (Slideshow)
    
* `openapi-video-story.yaml` (Video/Story)
    

* * *

3. **Run a Mock Server**
------------------------

Each pack can be run on its own port:

```bash
# Providers API mock on port 4009
prism mock openapi-providers.yaml --port 4009

# Slideshow API mock on port 4010
prism mock openapi-slideshow.yaml --port 4010

# Video/Story API mock on port 4011
prism mock openapi-video-story.yaml --port 4011
```

Prism will read the spec and auto-generate valid responses.

* * *

4. **Test It**
--------------

From curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4009/providers
```

Or with Postman using the **workspace + environments** I gave you:

* Select `Providers Environment` (baseUrl = `http://localhost:4009`)
    
* Hit `GET /providers`
    

* * *

5. **Switch Between Dynamic/Static Responses**
----------------------------------------------

Prism has two mock modes:

* **Static** (default): returns examples defined in your spec.
    
* **Dynamic**: generates random but schema-valid responses.
    

Enable dynamic:

```bash
prism mock openapi-providers.yaml --port 4009 --dynamic
```

* * *

6. **Iterate**
--------------

* Update the OpenAPI spec when endpoints evolve.
    
* Restart Prism to refresh mocks.
    
* Use Postman collections to test end-to-end flows.
    

* * *

💡 This gets you a **working API server in minutes**, perfect for front-end or integration testing before you’ve written any backend code.

* * *

Do you want me to also show you how to **bundle all three specs into a single Prism mock** (so you don’t have to run three servers), or keep them separate for now?

* * *

**You:**

yes

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Perfect — let’s bundle your three specs into **one mock API server** so you can run everything from a single Prism instance.

* * *

🌐 One-Server Mock with Prism
=============================

1. **Combine the Specs**
------------------------

Prism can only serve **one OpenAPI file at a time**, so we create a **root spec** that `$ref`s the other three.

👉 Example: `openapi-potterlabs.yaml`

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
  title: Potterlabs API (Unified Mock)
  version: 0.1.0
servers:
  - url: http://localhost:4010

paths:
  # Providers
  /providers:
    $ref: './openapi-providers.yaml#/paths/~1providers'
  /providers/{id}/capabilities:
    $ref: './openapi-providers.yaml#/paths/~1providers~1{id}~1capabilities'

  # Slideshow
  /slideshow:
    $ref: './openapi-slideshow.yaml#/paths/~1slideshow'

  # Video/Story
  /story:
    $ref: './openapi-video-story.yaml#/paths/~1story'
```

⚠️ Note:

* The `~1` syntax is OpenAPI’s way of escaping `/`.
    
* All three YAML files (`openapi-providers.yaml`, `openapi-slideshow.yaml`, `openapi-video-story.yaml`) must be in the same folder.
    

* * *

2. **Run the Unified Mock**
---------------------------

```bash
prism mock openapi-potterlabs.yaml --port 4010
```

Now you have:

* `GET http://localhost:4010/providers`
    
* `GET http://localhost:4010/providers/{id}/capabilities`
    
* `POST http://localhost:4010/slideshow`
    
* `POST http://localhost:4010/story`
    

* * *

3. **Point Postman to It**
--------------------------

* Use your **updated workspace**.
    
* Add a new **Potterlabs Unified Environment** with `baseUrl = http://localhost:4010`.
    
* Switch to that env → all requests hit the single mock.
    

* * *

4. **Iterate Smoothly**
-----------------------

* Update any of the individual specs (providers, slideshow, video/story).
    
* Your `openapi-potterlabs.yaml` stays the same.
    
* Restart Prism to reload.
    

* * *

✅ This way you can still keep **services separate for development**, but also spin up a **unified mock** when you want to test cross-service flows.

* * *

Do you want me to generate the actual `openapi-potterlabs.yaml` file for you (with all the correct `$ref` syntax pre-wired), so you can just drop it into your folder and run?

* * *

**You:**

what should the baseurl be for slideshow API....http://localhost: what should the port be

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Earlier we assigned each subgroup its own port so they wouldn’t collide:

* **Providers API** → `http://localhost:4009`
    
* **Slideshow API** → `http://localhost:4010`
    
* **Video/Story API** → `http://localhost:4011`
    

So for the **Slideshow API**, your `baseUrl` should be:

```
http://localhost:4010
```

👉 That’s what you’ll set in Postman (Slideshow Environment) or in your curl commands.

Do you want me to also prep the **Potterlabs Unified Environment** (`http://localhost:4010`) so you can switch easily between _slideshow-only_ vs _unified mock_?

* * *

**You:**

yes

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Great — here’s a ready-to-import **Postman environment** for the unified mock server:

* 👉 **Download `potterlabs-unified-env.postman_environment.json`**
    

If you don’t see the file for some reason, here’s the JSON you can paste into Postman as a new environment:

```json
{
  "id": "potterlabs-unified-env",
  "name": "Potterlabs Unified (Local)",
  "values": [
    { "key": "baseUrl", "value": "http://localhost:4010", "enabled": true }
  ],
  "_postman_variable_scope": "environment",
  "_postman_exported_using": "ChatGPT Cherry"
}
```

Use this when you’re running the **unified Prism mock** (all packs via one `openapi-potterlabs.yaml` on port `4010`).

* * *

**You:**

it says it expired

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Here you go — fresh export:

👉 Download `potterlabs-unified-env.postman_environment.json`

Import this into Postman, and you’ll have a **Unified Environment** that points `{{baseUrl}}` at `http://localhost:4010`. Perfect for when you’re running the unified Prism mock.

* * *

**You:**

is this different from the openapi-potterlabs.yaml you made earlier

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yes — they serve different purposes:

* **`openapi-potterlabs.yaml`** → the **spec file** you feed into Prism.
    
    * It pulls in (`$ref`) all the sub-specs (providers, slideshow, video/story).
        
    * Running `prism mock openapi-potterlabs.yaml --port 4010` spins up the **unified mock server**.
        
* **`potterlabs-unified-env.postman_environment.json`** → a **Postman environment**.
    
    * It just sets a `baseUrl` variable (`http://localhost:4010`) so that your Postman collection requests resolve against the unified server.
        
    * It doesn’t define endpoints — the collection does that.
        

So:

* `openapi-potterlabs.yaml` = **the mock API’s contract**.
    
* `potterlabs-unified-env.postman_environment.json` = **the Postman switch to point requests to the unified mock**.
    

⚡ Together: run Prism with the YAML, then test it via Postman using the env.

Do you want me to generate the actual `openapi-potterlabs.yaml` file (fully wired `$ref`s to your three packs) so you don’t have to hand-stitch it?

* * *

**You:**

yes

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

All set! I generated a **unified OpenAPI** that references your three packs so you can run a single Prism mock:

* 👉 Download `openapi-potterlabs.yaml`
    

### How to use it

1. Put this file **in the same folder** as:
    
    * `openapi-providers.yaml`
        
    * `openapi-slideshow.yaml`
        
    * `openapi-video-story.patch.yaml`
        
2. Start the unified mock:
    
    ```bash
    prism mock openapi-potterlabs.yaml --port 4010
    ```
    
3. Point Postman to `{{baseUrl}} = http://localhost:4010` (use the unified env I gave you).
    

Endpoints included (via `$ref`):

* **Providers:** `/providers`, `/providers/{id}`, `/providers/{id}/capabilities`
    
* **Slideshow:** `/v1/assets`, `/v1/scripts`, `/v1/voices`, `/v1/voiceovers`, `/v1/beats`, `/v1/images`, `/v1/slideshows`, `/v1/background-music`, `/v1/slideshow-videos`, `/v1/events`, `/v1/jobs/{job_id}/logs` (+ their `{id}` routes)
    
* **Video/Story:** `/v1/videos`, `/v1/storyboards`, `/v1/stories` (+ their `{id}` routes)
    

If you want me to add or remove any paths from the unified file, say the word and I’ll tweak it.

* * *

**You:**

will postman work with the baseurl set to localhost

* * *

**ChatGPT:**

Yep ✅ — Postman works fine with `localhost` as the `baseUrl`.

Here’s how it plays out in your setup:

* You run Prism locally:
    
    ```bash
    prism mock openapi-potterlabs.yaml --port 4010
    ```
    
    → This binds to `http://localhost:4010`.
    
* In your Postman **environment**, set:
    
    ```json
    { "key": "baseUrl", "value": "http://localhost:4010" }
    ```
    
* In your collection requests, use `{{baseUrl}}`:
    
    ```
    GET {{baseUrl}}/providers
    GET {{baseUrl}}/v1/slideshows
    GET {{baseUrl}}/v1/videos
    ```
    

👉 Postman will resolve `{{baseUrl}}` → `http://localhost:4010`, and it will hit your running Prism mock.

The only caveat: if you want to share with teammates outside your machine, you’d need to swap `localhost` for your LAN IP or a tunneled URL (ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel, etc.).

Do you want me to also prep an **ngrok/Cloudflare Tunnel setup** so your teammates (or even front-end devs in Vercel) can hit your local Prism mock?

* * *

**You:**

let me share with you the progress report of where the developer, Codex CLI is at: codex
Progress Summary

- Providers + Slideshow mocks, a FastAPI server scaffold, validation utilities, and contributor
docs are in place and tested locally.

Repository Docs

- AGENTS.md: Added and later updated to include app/ FastAPI server, Prism usage, run commands,
and testing guidance.
- Notes preserved: Root OpenAPI placeholders and pack structure remain unchanged.

Prism Mocks

- Scripts: providers/mock.sh and slideshow/mock.sh with PORT and MODE=examples|dynamic.
- Behavior: Default to example-first mode; dynamic mode available for variability.
- Verification curls documented and tested.

OpenAPI Updates

- Providers examples: Embedded canonical examples in providers/openapi-providers.yaml for:
    - GET /providers, GET /providers/{id}, and GET /providers/{id}/capabilities.
- New provider: Added OpenRouter to providers/examples/providers.json and text-gen to providers/
examples/capabilities.json.
- Cleanup: Removed temporary static routes (/providers/openrouter*) to keep paths parameterized.

FastAPI Server

- Deps: requirements.txt (FastAPI, Uvicorn, jsonschema).
- App: app/main.py with /health, middleware, and routers.
- Providers router: app/routers/providers.py
    - Async GETs: /providers, /providers/{id}, /providers/{id}/capabilities.
    - Sources data from providers/examples/*.json; optional capability map (openrouter →
text-gen).
- Slideshow router: app/routers/slideshow.py (prefix /v1)
    - POST with JSON Schema validation + response stubs for: /scripts, /beats, /images, /
voiceovers, /background-music, /slideshows, /slideshow-videos.
    - GET/list/status: minimal stubs for lists and item fetches (IDs populated, basic fields set).
    - Voices/Assets: POST /voices, POST/GET /assets.

Validation & Idempotency

- Middleware: Warns if Idempotency-Key missing on POST; requests continue.
- JSON Schema: app/utils/validation.py validates bodies, returns 422 on failure.
- Stub generation: app/utils/stubgen.py creates minimal, schema-conformant response bodies.

How To Run

- Install: python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt
- Start: uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 4009
- Test providers: curl http://localhost:4009/providers | jq .
- Test slideshow POST: curl -X POST http://localhost:4009/v1/images -H "Content-Type: application/
json" -H "Idempotency-Key: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -d @slideshow/examples/
images.create.json | jq .

Not Yet Done

- Provider fallback stubs from providers/schemas/*.
- SSE /v1/events, ETag headers, and consistent error payloads across groups.
- Response examples under slideshow/examples/*.response.json.
- Linting/bundle scripts (Spectral, bundling to potterlabs-api-bundle/).

Proposed Next Steps

- Add consistent 404/422 error shapes and ETag headers per spec.
- Implement minimal in-memory job state for slideshow GETs.
- Optional: add Spectral lint and a bundle script for combined specs.

**ChatGPT:**

Cherry here — awesome progress. I’ll turn that into a tight, actionable plan you can hand to Codex CLI. No merging or scope creep — just closing gaps to a solid v1 mock + stub.

✅ What’s good (lock it)
=======================

* Prism mocks with `MODE=examples|dynamic`
    
* FastAPI scaffold with providers + slideshow routers
    
* Request validation + idempotency warning middleware
    
* Docs/run scripts
    

🎯 Next 10 tasks (small, testable, in order)
============================================

1. **Uniform error envelope (+422/404 helpers)**
    

* Shape (matches spec style you’ve been using):
    

```python
# app/utils/errors.py
from fastapi import HTTPException

def err(code: str, message: str, status: int = 400, field: str | None = None, hint: str | None = None):
    raise HTTPException(status_code=status, detail={"error": {
        "code": code, "message": message, "field": field, "hint": hint
    }})
```

* Use in routers:
    

```python
from app.utils.errors import err
# 422 example
if not body_ok:
    err("invalid_param", "payload failed schema validation", 422, field="images.prompt")
# 404 example
if not found:
    err("not_found", "resource not found", 404)
```

2. **ETag headers for GETs**
    

* Cheap deterministic ETag from the response body:
    

```python
# app/utils/etag.py
import hashlib, json
def etag_for(obj) -> str:
    return hashlib.sha256(json.dumps(obj, sort_keys=True).encode()).hexdigest()[:32]
```

* In route:
    

```python
from fastapi import Response
body = {...}
response = Response(media_type="application/json")
response.headers["ETag"] = etag_for(body)
response.body = json.dumps(body).encode()
return response
```

3. **In‑memory job state for slideshow**
    

* Minimal state machine + TTL:
    

```python
# app/state/jobs.py
import time, uuid
JOBS = {}  # id -> dict

def create_job(kind:str, payload:dict):
    jid = f"{kind[:2]}_{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}"
    JOBS[jid] = {"id": jid, "kind": kind, "status": "queued", "created_at": time.time(), "payload": payload}
    return JOBS[jid]

def get_job(jid): return JOBS.get(jid)

def advance(jid, to="succeeded"):
    if jid in JOBS: JOBS[jid]["status"] = to; return JOBS[jid]
```

* Use in `/v1/images`, `/v1/voiceovers`, `/v1/background-music`, `/v1/slideshow-videos` POST → return `queued/running`, GET → return final stub (`artifact` URLs).
    

4. **Idempotency-Key memory cache**
    

* Cache by `(path, idempotency_key)` → stored response for ~24h.
    

```python
# app/middleware/idempotency.py
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware
import time

CACHE = {}  # (method, path, key) -> (ts, status, headers, body)

class IdempotencyMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request, call_next):
        if request.method == "POST":
            key = request.headers.get("Idempotency-Key")
            k = (request.method, str(request.url.path), key or "")
            if key and k in CACHE:
                ts, status, headers, body = CACHE[k]
                resp = Response(content=body, status_code=status, media_type="application/json")
                for h,v in headers.items(): resp.headers[h] = v
                return resp
            resp = await call_next(request)
            if key:
                CACHE[k] = (time.time(), resp.status_code, dict(resp.headers), resp.body)
            return resp
        return await call_next(request)
```

* Add cleanup on startup or per-request if `ts` older than 24h.
    

5. **SSE `/v1/events`**
    

* Emit basic job updates from the in‑memory state:
    

```python
# app/routers/events.py
from fastapi import APIRouter
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
import asyncio, json

router = APIRouter()

async def event_stream():
    # naive demo: tick every second
    while True:
        # emit whatever changed; or just heartbeat
        yield f"event: ping\ndata: {json.dumps({'ts': time.time()})}\n\n"
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

@router.get("/v1/events")
async def events():
    return StreamingResponse(event_stream(), media_type="text/event-stream")
```

* Curl test:
    

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:4009/v1/events
```

6. **Response examples (goldens)**
    

* Under `slideshow/examples/*.response.json` add one successful example per POST + per GET.
    
* Wire Prism to `MODE=examples` by default (already done).
    

7. **Consistent 201/202 usage**
    

* Resource-creation that’s immediate (`/scripts`, `/slideshows`) → `201`
    
* Async long-runs (`/images`, `/voiceovers`, `/background-music`, `/slideshow-videos`) → `202`
    
* Ensure FastAPI routes return matching status codes.
    

8. **ETags + conditional GET (optional stretch)**
    

* If request has `If-None-Match: <etag>`, return `304` if unchanged.
    

9. **Spectral + bundle script**
    

* Add `spectral.yaml` with a few rules (operationId required, response 4xx/5xx must use error shape).
    
* NPM script:
    

```json
"scripts": {
  "lint:openapi": "spectral lint providers/openapi-providers.yaml slideshow/openapi-slideshow.yaml",
  "mock:providers": "MODE=examples PORT=4009 bash providers/mock.sh",
  "mock:slideshow": "MODE=examples PORT=4010 bash slideshow/mock.sh"
}
```

10. **Minimal tests (pytest)**
    

* One test per endpoint that asserts:
    
    * Status code (201/202/200/404/422)
        
    * Error envelope shape on bad payload
        
    * `ETag` header exists on GETs
        

* * *

Small deltas Codex can apply immediately
----------------------------------------

* **Providers router:** add `GET /providers/{id}` (you already have), ensure 404 uses the new helper.
    
* **Slideshow router:** wrap all POST bodies with schema validation (already), return `201` for `/v1/scripts`, `/v1/slideshows`, `202` for the async ones.
    
* **Jobs:** swap static stubs for `create_job("images", payload)` etc., and make GETs return job by id with a fake `artifact.url` after first poll.
    
* **Docs:** expand `AGENTS.md` with curl “goldens” per endpoint; add SSE example.
    

* * *

Sanity checks / acceptance criteria
-----------------------------------

* `POST /v1/images` without body → `422` with `{ "error": { code, message, field } }`.
    
* `GET /v1/voiceovers/{id}` for missing id → `404` with same envelope.
    
* `GET /v1/scripts/{id}` returns `ETag` header (32-hex hash).
    
* `POST /v1/slideshow-videos` twice with same `Idempotency-Key` → identical response body + headers.
    
* `curl -N /v1/events` streams lines (no buffering).
    

* * *

Nice-to-have (very small)
-------------------------

* Add `X-Request-ID` per request (uuid4) and log it.
    
* Add `/health/ready` + `/health/live` endpoints.
    

If you want, I can drop in ready-made files for **errors.py, etag.py, jobs.py, idempotency.py, events.py** sized to your project layout — but this list should be enough for Codex to implement without guessing.
